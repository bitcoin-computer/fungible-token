# Bitcoin Token

A hackable token for LTC. Intended as a starting point for developers to build on top of. Build on the [Bitcoin Computer](http://bitcoincomputer.io) library.

The smart contract itself could not be simpler:

````
class Token {
  constructor(to, supply, name) {
    this.coins = supply
    this._owners = [to]
    this.name = name
  }

  send(amount, to) {
    if (this.coins < amount) throw new Error()
    this.coins -= amount
    return new Token(to, amount, this.name)
  }
}
````

The constructor creates a new Token object that stores ``amount`` tokens and that is owned by a public key ``to``. The send function first checks for insufficient funds. If there are sufficient funds, a new object with ``number`` tokens is created and the amount in the current token is reduced by ``number``. As this is the only way to update the amount of a token this guarantees that the total number of tokens remains constant.

## Start the app

Clone the repo and run

````
npm run start
````

To log in you need a BIP39 seed phrase. You can generate a new seed for example from [here](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/). You then need to fund the wallet using a [LTC faucet](https://testnet-faucet.com/ltc-testnet/)

For more information see the [Bitcoin Computer Docs](https://docs.bitcoincomputer.io/getting-started/run-in-a-browser) or ask in the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/FMrjOUWRuUkNuIt7zJL8tg).

## Contributing

The app is very bare bones and contributions are more than welcome. Have a look at the open issues, or make a pull request with a new feature. You can also request a feature request by creating an issue.
